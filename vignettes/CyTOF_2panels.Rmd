This vignette will demonstrate the batch correction of a CyTOF dataset, where samples were measured using two different panels. Not only will batch correction be performed, but we will also impute the non-overlapping markers allowing for a much more direct integration of these data.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  strip.white = T, comment = ""
)

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/home/projects/dp_immunoth/people/s153398/cyCombine/_data/')

```

<br>

This is data from a study of CLL patients and healthy donors at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). Protein expression was quantified using two different panels of proteins with an overlap. The data generated with each panel was processed in eight batches. The data is B-cell depleted.

<br>


#### Pre-processing data

In this dataset, it seems reasonable to start by looking at the two panels.

```{r libraries, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Loading packages
library(cyCombine)
library(tidyverse)

# Set a seed for reproducibility
seed <- 124

# Set a combined size for UMAPs
umap_size = 50000

```

```{r panel reading, message=F, warning=F}
# Panel 1 reading
panel1 <- read_csv("dfci1/panel1.csv")
panel1

# Panel 2 reading
panel2 <- read_csv("dfci2/panel2.csv")
panel2

```

Now, we have the panels - so let us extract the markers and identify the overlap.

```{r panel overlap}
# Extracting the markers
markers1 <- panel1 %>%
  filter(Type != "none") %>%
  pull(Marker) %>%
  str_remove_all("[ _-]")

markers2 <- panel2 %>%
  filter(Type != "none") %>%
  pull(Marker) %>%
  str_remove_all("[ _-]")

# Defining overlap
overlap_markers <- intersect(markers1, markers2)
overlap_markers

```

We observe that there is a total of 15 overlapping markers. These span a lot of the major cell types (eg. CD3, CD4, and CD8 for T cells, CD56 for NK cells and CD14 and CD33 for myeloid cell types).

<br>

The workflow presented in this vignette can be visualized with the following schematic. Dataset a and b are the the datasets for the two panels here.

We are now ready to load the CyTOF data. We convert it to a tibble format, which is easy to process. We use cofactor = 5 (default) for asinh-transformation.


```{r loading cytof data 1}
# Preparing the expression data
dfci1 <- prepare_data(data_dir = "dfci1",
                      metadata = "dfci1/metadata.csv",
                      filename_col = "FCS_name",
                      batch_ids = "Batch",
                      condition = "Set",
                      markers = markers1,
                      down_sample = FALSE)

```


```{r loading cytof data 2}
# Preparing the expression data
dfci2 <- prepare_data(data_dir = "dfci2",
                      metadata = "dfci2/metadata.csv",
                      filename_col = "FCS_name",
                      batch_ids = "Batch",
                      condition = "Set",
                      markers = markers2,
                      down_sample = FALSE)

```

<br>

#### Processing data - batch correction

#### Panel 1 - batch correction

In this case, the dataset for each panel is, as mentioned, run in eight batches - this means that there are likely some batch effects to correct for within each panel as well. We take of this first, before we start integrating across panels!


```{r batch correction within panels 1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Run batch correction for panel 1
dfci1_bc <- dfci1 %>%
  batch_correct(covar = "condition",
                xdim = 8,
                ydim = 8,
                norm_method = 'scale',
                markers = markers1)
```

<br>

Let us have a quick look at some UMAPs to visualize the correction for each batch. We downsample so it is easier to see what is going on.

```{r umaps 1, fig.height=8, fig.width=16}
# Downsampling and making pre- and post-correction UMAPs for panel 1 data
set.seed(seed)
dfci1_sliced <- dfci1 %>%
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = umap_size)

dfci1_bc_sliced <- dfci1_sliced %>%
  select(id) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(dfci1_bc, by = "id")


# UMAP plot uncorrected
umap1 <- dfci1_sliced %>%
  plot_dimred(name = "uncorrected (panel 1)", type = "umap", markers = markers1)

# UMAP plot corrected
umap2 <- dfci1_bc_sliced %>%
  plot_dimred(name = "corrected (panel 1)", type = "umap", markers = markers1)

# Show plots
cowplot::plot_grid(umap1, umap2)
```


Now, let us view the expression distributions for all the markers in panel 1.

```{r density plots 1, fig.height=12, fig.width=20, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Plot density before/after
plot_density(uncorrected = dfci1,
             corrected = dfci1_bc,
             markers = markers1,
             format = 1, ncol = 6)
```

Finally, we will evaluate the EMD reduction for the batch correction of panel 1. To do this, we first need to perform a clustering of the corrected set, and we will transfer the labels to the uncorrected set for direct comparison.

```{r EMD 1, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Generate labels for EMD evaluation
labels <- dfci1_bc %>%
  create_som(seed = seed,
             xdim = 8,
             ydim = 8,
             markers = markers1)

# Add labels to datasets
dfci1_bc <- dfci1_bc %>%
  dplyr::mutate(som = labels)
celltype_col <- "som"

dfci1 <- dfci1_bc %>%
  dplyr::select(id, all_of(celltype_col)) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(dfci1, by = "id")


# Evaluate Earth Movers Distance
emd_val1 <- dfci1 %>%
  evaluate_emd(dfci1_bc, markers = markers1, cell_col = celltype_col)

# Show plots
cowplot::plot_grid(emd_val1$violin, emd_val1$scatterplot)
```

<br>

#### Panel 2 - batch correction

Now, it is time to do the same with the data from panel 2. First, we batch correct:

```{r batch correction within panels 2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Run batch correction for panel 2
dfci2_bc <- dfci2 %>%
  batch_correct(covar = "condition",
                xdim = 8,
                ydim = 8,
                norm_method = 'scale',
                markers = markers2)

```

<br>

We look at the UMAPs.

```{r umaps 2, fig.height=8, fig.width=16}
# Downsampling and making pre- and post-correction UMAPs for panel 2 data
set.seed(seed)
dfci2_sliced <- dfci2 %>%
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = umap_size)

dfci2_bc_sliced <- dfci2_sliced %>%
  select(id) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(dfci2_bc, by = "id")


# UMAP plot uncorrected
umap1 <- dfci2_sliced %>%
  plot_dimred(name = "uncorrected (panel 2)", type = "umap", markers = markers2)

# UMAP plot corrected
umap2 <- dfci2_bc_sliced %>%
  plot_dimred(name = "corrected (panel 2)", type = "umap", markers = markers2)


# Show plots
cowplot::plot_grid(umap1, umap2)

```

And we take a look at the marker distributions for panel 2

```{r density plots 2, fig.height=18, fig.width=20, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Plot density before/after
plot_density(uncorrected = dfci2,
             corrected = dfci2_bc,
             markers = markers2,
             format = 1, ncol = 5)
```

Lastly, we evaluate the EMD reduction for the batch correction of panel 2 in the same manner as presented above.

```{r EMD 2, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Generate labels for EMD evaluation
labels <- dfci2_bc %>%
  create_som(seed = seed,
             xdim = 8,
             ydim = 8,
             markers = markers2)

# Add labels
dfci2_bc <- dfci2_bc %>%
  dplyr::mutate(som = labels)
celltype_col <- "som"

dfci2 <- dfci2_bc %>%
  dplyr::select(id, all_of(celltype_col)) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(dfci2, by = "id")


# Evaluate Earth Movers Distance
emd_val2 <- dfci2 %>%
  evaluate_emd(dfci2_bc, markers = markers2, cell_col = celltype_col)

# Show plots
cowplot::plot_grid(emd_val2$violin, emd_val2$scatterplot)
```

<br>

For both panels, we find EMD reductions of 0.68 and 0.67, respectively, when considering the batch corrections separately.

<br>

#### Combined batch correction

Based on the marker distributions after correction and the UMAPs, it looks like the batch effects within the data for each panel are minimized. Now we can focus on the integration of the two sets. The first step here, is to batch correct the datasets based on the overlapping markers.


```{r co-correction, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Generate a combined tibble for the two datasets
df <- rbind(dfci1_bc[,c(overlap_markers, 'sample', 'condition')], 
            dfci2_bc[,c(overlap_markers, 'sample', 'condition')]) %>%
  mutate('batch' = c(rep(1, nrow(dfci1_bc)), rep(2, nrow(dfci2_bc))),
         'id' = 1:(nrow(dfci1_bc)+nrow(dfci2_bc)))

# Make sample names unique (some of the same samples are stained with panel 1 and panel 2)
df$sample <- paste0(df$batch, '-', df$sample)


# Batch correct based on overlapping markers
co_corrected <- batch_correct(df,
                              covar = "condition",
                              xdim = 8,
                              ydim = 8,
                              norm_method = 'scale',
                              markers = overlap_markers)
```

<br>

Similarly to the corrections *within* each panel's data, we can now look at the UMAPs and marker distributions before and after correction - and we can also calculate the EMD reduction.

```{r umaps 3, fig.height=8, fig.width=16}
# Downsampling and making pre- and post-correction UMAPs for the combined data (on overlapping markers)
set.seed(seed)
df_sliced <- df %>%
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = umap_size)

co_corrected_sliced <- df_sliced %>%
  select(id) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(co_corrected, by = "id")


# UMAP plot uncorrected
umap1 <- df_sliced %>%
  plot_dimred(name = "uncorrected (combined)", type = "umap", markers = overlap_markers)

# UMAP plot corrected
umap2 <- co_corrected_sliced %>%
  plot_dimred(name = "corrected (combined)", type = "umap", markers = overlap_markers)


# Show plots
cowplot::plot_grid(umap1, umap2)
```


```{r density plots 3, fig.height=6, fig.width=20, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Plot density before/after
plot_density(uncorrected = df,
             corrected = co_corrected,
             markers = overlap_markers,
             format = 2, ncol = 5)
```

And the EMD reduction:

```{r EMD 3, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Generate labels for EMD evaluation
labels <- co_corrected %>%
  create_som(seed = seed,
             xdim = 8,
             ydim = 8,
             markers = overlap_markers)

# Add labels
co_corrected <- co_corrected %>%
  dplyr::mutate(som = labels)
celltype_col <- "som"

df <- co_corrected %>%
  dplyr::select(id, all_of(celltype_col)) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(df, by = "id")


# Evaluate Earth Movers Distance
emd_val_co <- df %>%
  evaluate_emd(co_corrected, markers = overlap_markers, cell_col = celltype_col)

# Show plots
cowplot::plot_grid(emd_val_co$violin, emd_val_co$scatterplot)
```

For this correction, we obtain an EMD of 0.85.

#### Imputing non-overlapping markers

Now that we have batch corrected the overlapping markers from the two panels, they are directly comparable. However, when limiting ourselves only to the overlapping set, we also remove all information contained in the non-overlapping markers. In this case, panel 1 contains 21 markers not found in panel 2 - and panel 2 has 19 markers not found in panel 1. These markers include CD16, which is important for NK cells and monocyte distinction and Granzyme A, which is important to deeply characterize cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. 

We want to include these markers in our dataset, but because the non-overlapping markers were only measured on roughly half of the cells, we have to use imputation to provide a value for the other panel's cells.

We start by defining the sets of non-overlapping markers and then add the values for these to the batch corrected values for the overlapping markers for each panel.


```{r adding non-overlap to co-corrected}
# Define the non-overlaping markers
missing1 <- markers2[!markers2 %in% markers1] # 19 markers measured only in panel 2
missing2 <- markers1[!markers1 %in% markers2] # 21 markers measured only in panel 1


# Add non-overlapping markers back to df
co_corrected1 <- bind_cols(co_corrected[co_corrected$batch == 1,], dfci1_bc[,missing2])
co_corrected2 <- bind_cols(co_corrected[co_corrected$batch == 2,], dfci2_bc[,missing1])

```

<br>

We are now ready to impute the values for the markers unique panel 2 for the panel 1 data - and vice versa.

```{r imputation}
# Imputation for whole panels
imputed <- impute_across_panels(dataset1 = co_corrected1, 
                                dataset2 = co_corrected2,
                                overlap_channels = overlap_markers, 
                                impute_channels1 = missing1,
                                impute_channels2 = missing2)

# Extract data for each panel
final1 <- imputed$dataset1
final2 <- imputed$dataset2

```

<br>
Now, we are ready to use this combined dataset to answer the biological questions and make nice visualizations.
Let us look at *all* of the markers after batch corrections and imputation.


```{r density plots final, fig.height=25, fig.width=20, message=F, warning=F}
plot_density(final1, 
             final2, 
             y = 'Type',
             dataset_names = paste('Panel', 1:2),
             ncol = 5)

```

This looks very nice in terms of obtaining comparable distributions between the cells originating from each panel.

Let us make a UMAP for the combined set - based on all 55 markers (15 overlapping + 21 unique to panel 1 + 19 unique to panel 2). 

```{r umap final, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, message=F, warning=F}
# Combining dataset
final <- rbind(final1,
               final2)

# Down-sampling for plot
set.seed(seed)
final_sliced <- final %>%
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = umap_size)

# UMAP plot corrected
umap <- final_sliced %>%
  cyCombine::plot_dimred(name = "corrected", 
                         type = "umap", 
                         markers = c(overlap_markers, missing1, missing2), 
                         return_coord = T)

umap$plot
```

After running this process, it is possible to perform any processing one finds relevant for the dataset. In this case, we proceeded to cluster the data using SOM and ConsensusClusterPlus on the following 20 markers: CD3, CD45RA, CD14, CD45RO, CD152, CD33, CD4, CD8, CD197, CD56, FoxP3, CD25, CD1c, CD1d, CD11c, CD16, CD34, CD11b, FCeR1a, XCL1

The clusters were annotated manually based on the protein expression levels. Let us load these labels and add them to the UMAP.

```{r label adding, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
# Load labels and add to final frame
final$label <- readRDS('dfci/labels_combined.rds')

# Slice to subset as generated above
final_sliced <- final_sliced %>%
  select(id) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(final, by = "id")

# Use UMAP coordinates determined above
final_df <- cbind.data.frame(umap$dimred, 
                             final_sliced)
colnames(final_df)[1:2] <- paste0('UMAP', 1:2)

ggplot(final_df, aes(x = UMAP1,
                     y = UMAP2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = label), 
             alpha = 0.3, size = 0.4, shape = 1) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1,
                                                  size = 1))) + 
  theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  ggtitle(paste("UMAP - final"))


```

<br>

Finally, let us compare the cell type fractions between the data originally derived from each panel.


```{r cell type fractions, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
# Get a matrix of cluster counts - convert it to percentage
counts <- table(final$batch, final$label)
perc <- (counts/rowSums(counts))*100

# Convert perc table into a dataframe for plotting
df_perc <- cbind.data.frame(perc[1,], perc[2,], colnames(perc))
colnames(df_perc) <- c('Batch1', 'Batch2', 'Population')
df_perc$Population <- factor(df_perc$Population, levels = levels(final$label))

# Make the plot
ggplot(df_perc, aes_string(x = 'Batch1', y = 'Batch2')) +
  geom_point(aes_string(color = 'Population')) +
  theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  ggtitle('Cluster percentages') +
  xlab('Panel 1 (% of cells)') + ylab('Panel 2 (% of cells)')



# Calculate the correlation
cor(df_perc$Batch1, df_perc$Batch2, method = 'pearson')
```
