This vignette will demonstrate the batch correction of a CyTOF dataset, where samples were measured using two different panels. Not only will batch correction be performed, but we will also impute the non-overlapping markers allowing for a much more direct integration of these data.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/home/projects/dp_immunoth/people/s153398/cyCombine/_data/')

```

Coming soon!
